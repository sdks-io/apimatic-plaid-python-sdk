    Raised by a transport, never by the pipeline. It is the one failure shape the retry loop can act
    on without knowing which HTTP library moved the bytes, which is what keeps that library named in
    a single module: a loop that caught ``httpx.ConnectError`` would have to import httpx to say so.

    A transport author's vocabulary, not a caller's. It is exported from ``core`` beside
    :class:`~.transport.HttpClient`, because custom transport has to raise it for the retry loop to
    act on a failed send -- whatever else that transport raises reaches the caller on the first
    attempt. A caller does not catch it: when the last attempt fails, ``execute`` raises
    :attr:`inner_exception` in this wrapper's place, ``from`` the cause that exception already
    carried -- which restates what it held rather than clearing it, and suppresses this wrapper from
    the chain it is printed with. So
    it adds nothing to what it wraps. Transport passes the original exception itself rather
    than a string of it, both as ``__cause__`` and as the single argument: ``Exception.__str__``
    renders a lone argument through ``str``, so the message reads identically, and nothing is
    flattened on the way through.
    A distinction worth narrowing on, a timeout against a refused connection among them, belongs to
    the exception the caller actually sees; the loop itself draws none, waiting the same curve for
    both, as the C# SDK does through one arm.

    A response that arrived and said 4xx or 5xx is not this -- that is an :class:`ApiError`, or a
    :class:`~.results.Failure` in the raw response mode. This type means there was no response."""
