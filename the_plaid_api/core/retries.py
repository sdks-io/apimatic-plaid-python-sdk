"""What to retry, how long to wait, and when to stop.

Decisions only, never action: the loop that sleeps and sends again is each raw client's

A retry is safe only when two things hold, and both are answered here: the request may be repeated
without knowing whether the server acted on it -- a method the policy names, failing in a way the
policy names -- and its body can go out again byte for byte (:func:`is_retryable_body`)."""

    """How many times to retry, how long to wait, and which failures qualify.

    Caller input, so its constraints are declared rather than hand-written, exactly as they are on
    :class:`~.request_options.RequestOptions`. The field counts *retries*, not attempts, so
    ``max_retries=0`` disables retrying -- the spelling the C# SDK's ``MaxRetries`` takes, and the
    one Stainless, Fern and APIMatic v1 all use, so a count reads the same wherever a caller met it
    before. The loop adds the initial attempt.

    Retries are counted rather than time budgeted. A wall-clock budget makes the elapsed time
    predictable and the attempt count arbitrary; counting retries makes the worst case
    ``max_retries + 1`` timeouts plus the delays between them -- every term of which the caller set.

    One status set under one method gate, and the gate covers a request that produced no response
    too. A 5xx or a 408 says the server may have processed the request; a dropped connection leaves
    that unknown; and a 429, though a refusal, is gated the same way rather than given a set of its
    own -- the shape the C# SDK's ``RetryOptions`` takes, so one policy reads the same in both.

        An instance passes straight through -- it validated itself when it was built -- and ``None``

        configured nothing gets the tuned policy, three retries on the idempotent methods. Turning it
        off is ``0`` (or ``{"max_retries": 0}``); asking with a count alone is a bare ``int``, which is
        ``max_retries`` and leaves every other field at its default. It is handed to that field
        unexamined, so it coerces exactly as ``max_retries`` does -- a ``bool`` included, ``True`` being

    Both RFC 9110 forms are read: delta-seconds, and an HTTP-date. A date already past floors at
    ``0.0`` -- the server is naming a moment, and a moment gone means *now*.

    Delta-seconds is read exactly as the grammar writes it, ``1*DIGIT``, and never through bare
    ``float`` -- which would take ``1_0`` as ten, ``inf`` as a wait beyond any ceiling, and ``1.5``
    and ``-5`` as values the grammar has no room for. So a non-conforming value is *unparseable*
    rather than quietly reinterpreted, and the floor above is the date branch's alone.

    An unparseable value yields ``None`` rather than raising. A malformed header is the server's
    defect, and turning a retryable failure into an exception would make the SDK's behavior worse
    than if the header had never been sent.

    The clock is the caller's: ``now`` is read in the raw client's ``_attempt_send``, once per
    retryable failure, immediately after its head arrives, and handed over. So the one branch that
    needs a reference moment names it as an argument rather than reaching for a global, which keeps
    this module free of ambient state and makes the date branch testable by passing a moment instead
    of patching ``datetime``.

    The field is found case-insensitively rather than by ``headers.get("retry-after")``. Both
    response protocols oblige a transport to lowercase its header names, and the shipped one does --
    but a custom transport that forgets would not fail here, it would silently ignore every
    ``Retry-After`` a server sends and wait out the curve instead. That is the kind of defect a
    caller never sees, so the one reader of a response header pays a scan of the head to be
    independent of the obligation. The scan runs only on a retryable failure.

    Args:
        headers: The failing response's head, scanned case-insensitively for the field.
        now: The moment an HTTP-date is measured against -- the loop's own reading of the clock,
            taken when the head arrived. Unused by the delta-seconds form.
