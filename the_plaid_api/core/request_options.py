"""Per-call request options -- the SDK's one override channel.

Every endpoint takes an optional ``request_options``, so a caller can override request-scoped
behaviour for a single call without re-configuring the client::

    client.body_params.send_long(5, request_options={"timeout": 5.0})

One bundled parameter rather than a keyword per knob. That is what keeps the set of names a
generated endpoint reserves at exactly one, however many options are added later: a new option is a
field here and collides with nobody's parameter.

Accepted either typed or dict-shaped, the same either-spelling convention the model input companions
use. :meth:`RequestOptions.coerce` is the one place the dict form is resolved, so the two spellings
cannot produce different requests.

A validated model rather than a plain frozen dataclass, because of who supplies the value: this is
caller input, so its constraints and its unknown-key rejection are declared here rather than
hand-written, exactly as they are for the configuration models. What the runtime *builds* --
including the resolved timeout that reaches a transport on :class:`HttpRequest` -- stays a plain
dataclass field, so no model crosses the transport boundary."""

    ``frozen`` matches every other value type in the runtime; ``extra="forbid"`` rejects a
    misspelled option that reached here without a type checker having seen the call.

    The retry terms are spelled **flat**, under the names :class:`~.retries.RetryOptions` gives them,
    and each one **merges** onto the client's policy rather than replacing it
    (:func:`apply_retry_overrides`, below): a field left ``None`` is a field the caller did not set,
    and the client's value stands. So overriding one term costs one key -- ``{"max_retries": 0}``
    turns retrying off for this call and moves nothing else -- where a nested policy obliged the
    caller to restate every term they were happy with in order to change one.

    Only the two terms that vary by call site are here: how many times *this* call may be retried,
    and which statuses count as transient for *this* endpoint. The wait curve -- ``initial_delay``,
    ``backoff_factor``, ``max_delay``, ``max_jitter`` -- describes how the server recovers, a fact
    about the API rather than about one call, and ``http_methods_to_retry`` is fixed by the method an
    endpoint was emitted with, so a per-call set could only agree with it or disable this call's

        overrides nothing takes neither validates nor allocates, and every read downstream stays
        unconditional as fields are added.

        Everything else is validated, an empty mapping and a falsy value of the wrong type included.
        ``None`` is the only short circuit deliberately: a caller no type checker saw is exactly who
        this validation is for, and absorbing their ``False`` or ``()`` as "no overrides" would
        leave them believing an override took effect.

    A function rather than a method, and not re-exported from ``core/__init__.py``: the two terms are
    a caller's to *write*, but folding them onto a policy is the raw client's business, and nothing a
    caller holds should offer it. The runtime's one caller is ``raw_client.execute``, once per
    request, in both flavours.

    The terms are a *layer over* ``retry_options``, never a policy of their own: each one the caller
    set replaces the client's value for this request, and each left ``None`` leaves the client's
    standing. ``None`` is therefore **unset rather than a value** -- the same reading ``timeout`` has,
    and the reading the dict spelling requires, since an omitted key and ``{"max_retries": None}``
    cannot be allowed to mean different things once the companion accepts both. The cost of that is
    one thing a caller cannot say: there is no per-call way to put a field *back* to the policy's own
    default, only to name the value they want.

    The client's policy is copied rather than rebuilt, which is what keeps this merge correct as the
    policy grows: a field this function has never heard of keeps the client's value instead of
    silently falling back to its class default. It is copied rather than revalidated because the
    overriding values were already validated against the very bounds ``RetryOptions`` declares --
    both models name ``MaxRetries``, and a status set has no bound -- so there is nothing left to
    re-check.

    A call that overrode nothing gets the client's own instance back, unwrapped and unallocated; that
    is the path every request takes.

    Args:
        options: The caller's per-call overrides, already coerced.
        retry_options: The client's policy -- what governs every term this call is silent about.
