"""Parsing the ``text/event-stream`` grammar: bytes in, event data out.

The WHATWG algorithm ("Server-sent events", HTML Standard) written as a push parser, so one
implementation serves both flavours: a consumer hands over each chunk the transport delivers and takes
back the events those bytes completed, and nothing here touches the wire. Per the standard: one leading
UTF-8 BOM is dropped; a line ends at CRLF, LF or CR; a line starting with ``:`` is a comment; ``data``
accumulates and its values join with LF; a blank line dispatches, but only when a ``data`` line was seen,
otherwise it resets; ``event``, ``id`` and ``retry`` are recognised so they are ignored correctly, and so
is any other field -- only ``data`` reaches the consumer.

Lines are found with ``bytes.splitlines``, which knows exactly the standard's three terminators and no
others -- unlike ``str.splitlines``, which also cuts on ``\\x0b``, ``\\x0c``, ``\\x1c`` to ``\\x1e``,
``\\x85`` and U+2028/9 and would split a payload holding one of them. It is one C pass per chunk,
measured at a twelfth of a regex loop's cost, and only the new chunk is ever scanned: the unfinished tail
of the previous chunk is carried and joined onto the first line the next chunk completes, so parsing
stays linear in the bytes received however small the chunks.

Two things the standard leaves to the client. A CR at the very end of a chunk is a terminator on its own,
and the LF that may follow it in the next chunk is then skipped, so a CRLF split across two reads is one
terminator, never two -- and the event dispatches the moment its CR arrives rather than waiting for the
next chunk. And an event still pending at EOF is dropped, as the standard's processing model says and as
the .NET parser does: a truncated final event is not delivered as if it were whole.

Each completed line is decoded as UTF-8 on its own, strictly. That is exact rather than a shortcut: both
terminator bytes are ASCII, and in UTF-8 an ASCII byte is never part of a multi-byte sequence, so a line
boundary cannot fall inside a character and no incremental decoder is needed. A line that is not UTF-8
raises the stdlib's ``UnicodeDecodeError``, unwrapped: it already names the offending byte and position.
The one bound is on bytes held for an event that has not dispatched -- the carried tail plus the ``data``
already collected -- so a server that never sends a blank line is refused at 1 MiB with a ``ValueError``
instead of growing the buffer without limit."""
