"""The seams every endpoint crosses: build a request, send it, shape a result.

One pipeline, two flavors, one seam. :class:`BaseRawClient` holds the half that does not depend
on concurrency -- resolving the API-wide, endpoint and caller parameter layers into a URL and
headers -- and each concrete client adds only the transport-touching ``execute``. Both flavors spell
it identically, so which flavor is in play is carried by the client a caller holds rather than by a
suffix on the method.

There is no ``_build_result`` beside ``_build_request`` any more. Shaping a result now needs the
response *and* its lifetime in the same place -- the 2xx return has to escape without closing, while
every other path closes -- and a static helper that could be handed a connection is one that can
leak it. The decoder owns the body it is given (ADR-0063), so what is left here is one status
branch, written out in each flavor because the two await differently.

The retry loop is each concrete client's private static ``_attempt_send``, spelled identically on
both, as ``execute`` is: it sends and, where every gate agrees, waits and sends again. It reads no
client state: ``execute`` hands it an ``on_send`` callable -- an inline lambda on sync, a local
``async def`` on async, since resolving auth there is awaited -- that builds the request, resolving
auth per attempt so a retry re-resolves it, and sends it through the client's own transport.
``execute`` then shapes whichever attempt it kept.

The two live in one module, with no ``async_raw_client.py`` beside it, because they are a peer pair:
the handful of ``await``s they differ by are visible on one screen, which is what keeps the sync and
async paths from drifting apart."""

class BaseRawClient(Generic[TransportT]):
    """Shared request-building and result-shaping for the raw clients.

    Holds the one transport its concurrency flavor can actually use -- the type
    parameter is what makes :class:`RawClient` provably sync and
    :class:`AsyncRawClient` provably async, so neither can be handed the other's
    transport. Subclasses add only the ``execute`` seam, which each writes out in its
    own flavor because the two await differently; the pipeline below is not duplicated
    and the sync/async boundary is never crossed.

    The three ``global_*`` fields carry the parameters the API applies to *every*
    request. They are derived from the API description, not from a caller: whoever
    generates this SDK writes them here, and an API that declares none leaves them
    empty. Each is combined with a single call's own parameters by the matching
    ``resolve_*`` function, so this class decides nothing about precedence -- it only
    says which two sides go in. All three are the same shape -- a sequence of
    parameters, each naming the type it was declared as -- which is what lets one
    ``param`` factory serve every location a request parameter can occupy, and what
    makes a wrongly-typed API-wide header a build failure rather than a wire bug.

    A single call's ``request_options`` is the third source: not what the API
    prescribes and not what the endpoint declares, but what the caller asked for this
    once. It is validated here, at the one place a request is built, so no emitted
    endpoint ever inspects an option.

    Authentication is a fourth source, and the full order for both headers and query parameters is::

        global_*  ->  the endpoint's own  ->  auth  ->  the caller's extra_headers

    Auth outranks the endpoint's own parameters because an operation parameter must not be able to
    clobber a credential, and loses to ``extra_headers`` because that is how a caller deliberately
    overrides one -- or blanks it, for a call meant to go out anonymous. Note that ``_build_request``
    takes already-resolved :class:`~.auth.AuthParams`, not a scheme: resolving a scheme may require
    I/O, so it happens in the ``on_send`` callable ``execute`` hands to ``_attempt_send``, once per
    attempt, which is the one place the two flavors already differ.

    A **401 invalidates whatever the scheme cached**, so a credential the server revoked ahead of its
    own expiry is re-obtained on the next call rather than resent until it times out. For every scheme
    that holds a constant this is one ``isinstance`` and nothing more. The failing request is
    **not** retried under the default policy, because 401 is not in its status set: a caller sees one
    401 and then recovery. A policy that adds 401 is retried, and each attempt re-resolves the
    credential the last one invalidated. Like scheme resolution it lives in the retry loop, beside
    the resolution it corrects rather than one module away from it; ``_build_request`` never sees the
    scheme, only the params it already resolved to."""

        retry re-resolve the auth scheme: a credential a 401 invalidated is re-obtained rather than
        resent. ``on_send`` takes no attempt number -- nothing in a request depends on which attempt it
        is. The ``Idempotency-Key`` is unaffected either way: the endpoint minted it into its own
        headers before this call, so every attempt carries the same one and a retried write is not a
        duplicate.

        A **401 invalidates whatever the scheme cached**, and it does so per attempt rather than once at
        the end: under a policy that names 401 in ``status_codes_to_retry`` the invalidation and the
        re-resolution that corrects it have to stay paired. The failing request is still not retried
        under the shipped defaults -- 401 is not in the default set -- so a caller sees one 401 and then
        recovery.

        A response the policy discards is **closed before the wait**, so a backoff never holds a

                replayability, folded together by the caller **once per call**, because answering the
                second walks a multipart body's parts and neither half can change between attempts.

        Three tokens differ: ``on_send`` is awaited (resolving a scheme may require I/O, and so does
        the transport), the close is ``aclose``, and the wait is ``asyncio.sleep`` rather than
        ``time.sleep`` so it yields the event loop instead of blocking it.

        Args:
            auth_scheme: The scheme this operation declares -- invalidated where the server answers 401.
            retry_options: The policy in force for this call, the caller's per-call terms already merged
                onto the client's.
            is_retryable: Whether this request may be repeated at all.
            on_send: Builds this attempt's request, resolving auth afresh, and sends it through the
                transport; awaited once per attempt.

        Returns:
            The kept attempt's response, open and its body unread.

``self._client.execute(...)`` exists -- it type-checked only because each subclass substitutes a
concrete argument. This bound also removes the ``Any``."""
